# Overview

By writing this software, I aimed to learn more about both Tkinter and Python. I experimented with using directories to organize files.

This is a Minesweeper clone that I made using Python. It had an easy, normal, and hard difficulty.

# Development Environment

I used VS Code as my IDE when writing this software.

I used Python as my programming language and the Tkinter package to aid me in making the game windows and setting the objects up in a graphical user interface.

# Useful Websites

* [Python Docs for Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
* [Python GUI Programming by Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-gui-tkinter/)

# Future Work

* Make more difficulties (maybe a sliding difficulty bar proprotional to how many squares get displayed)
* Add custom sounds for when a mine is tripped, when the user selects any square, and when a mine is defused.
* Make the graphical interface more appealing by adding a custom font for lives left and defusals and custom sprites for the mines and squares.
